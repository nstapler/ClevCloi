# [TheCleverCloister](https://nstapler.github.io/ClevCloi/)
The **CleverCloister** is a website for accruing my future productivity apps.  

**Key Points**  
* I built the website layout using mostly [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and html fundamentals.  
* I styled the page using a [bootstrap theme](https://bootswatch.com/).  
* The Applications were built using [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/), javascript and cleverness.  
# Below, you will find the base-pages of my website:  
* ## The Introductory Page  
    * [Home](https://nstapler.github.io/ClevCloi/home.html)  
* ## Application Showcase

* ## Contact Me

I hope to later update this website to utilize more modern methods and frameworks as I improve as a developer.  
For now, I will enjoy the simple proccess of problem-solving and creation.
